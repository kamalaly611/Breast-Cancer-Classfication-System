# Breast Cancer Classification System

## Introduction
This project is a breast cancer classification system, utilizing advanced technologies to accurately classify breast cancer types. The system integrates a front-end developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a Flask-based backend. The core of the classification relies on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically VGG-16, for model training. Data management is handled through an SQL database.

## Installation
To run this system, several technologies and dependencies need to be installed:
1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
2. Flask for frontend-backend integration.
3. VGG-16 for the CNN model.
4. SQL for database management.
5. Python and necessary libraries.
6. XAMPP for database management.
7. Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE) for coding.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
- Install Python on your system.
- Create a virtual environment.
- Activate the virtual environment.

### Installing Dependencies
- Inside the virtual environment, install all required Python libraries.
- Ensure Python and Flask are installed on your system.
- Clone the repository or download the source code.
-Install required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection in the application.
## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask
- Machine Learning Model: VGG-16 (CNN Architecture)
- Database: SQL




#Usage
Run the Flask app to start the server. Access the application through a web browser to register users, manage patient data, classify medical images, and generate reports.

## Features
- User and patient management.
- Medical image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Email functionalities for notifications.
- Dynamic PDF generation for reports and diagnostics.
- Comprehensive forms for data entry and validation.

## Dependencies
- Flask
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Flask-Mail
- MySQL
- pdfkit and wkhtmltopdf
- Additional Python libraries.

## Configuration
Configure the MySQL database settings, email server details, and file upload paths as per your environment.

## Documentation
The source code contains comments for easier understanding of the functionalities. Ensure to read the Flask and TensorFlow documentation for detailed understanding.

## Examples
- Registering a new user or patient.
- Classifying a medical image to detect specific conditions.
- Generating PDF reports for patient history and diagnostics.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all Python dependencies are installed.
- Verify the database and email configurations.
- Check for errors in the Flask server logs.
