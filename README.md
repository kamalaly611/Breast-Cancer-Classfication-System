# Breast Cancer Classification System

## Introduction
This project is a breast cancer classification system, utilizing advanced technologies to accurately classify breast cancer types. The system integrates a front-end developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a Flask-based backend. The core of the classification relies on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically VGG-16, for model training. Data management is handled through an SQL database.

## Installation
To run this system, several technologies and dependencies need to be installed:
1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
2. Flask for frontend-backend integration.
3. VGG-16 for the CNN model.
4. SQL for database management.
5. Python and necessary libraries.
6. XAMPP for database management.
7. Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE) for coding.
